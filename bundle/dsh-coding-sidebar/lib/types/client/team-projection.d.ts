/**
 * Derive the team tab's view from the Lead Session's **`agentTeam` Session
 * projection** (rc.1+ contract). Framework-free so the node test environment
 * can unit-test it (fixture: tests/team-projection.mjs).
 *
 * ## Why this exists (0.1.7 seam migration)
 *
 * Up to 0.1.6-alpha.2 the tab fetched the roster through the host route
 * `team.view`, which called the upstream service's `remoteView(agent)`.
 * 0.1.7 removed that method (with the whole `remote*` trio) — the surviving
 * read face is the Lead Session's **`agentTeam` projection**
 * (`projectionsBySession[leadId].values.agentTeam`), published push-style by
 * the host: the browser subscribes to the session-list feed and this module
 * maps the projection onto the tab's existing `TeamView` shape.
 *
 * Enrichment the old `remoteView` performed runtime-side and the projection
 * does not carry — live status, display names — is derived here from the
 * sessions feed (`byId`): a member id IS a Session id.
 *
 * A stale read of a removed field is SILENT by construction, so the derivation
 * returns `'loading'` until the projection value actually lands; the caller
 * requests it once via `sessions.refreshProjections(leadId)`.
